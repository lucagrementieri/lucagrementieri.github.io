  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a mathematician working on artificial intelligence applications in the research and development team at <a href="https://nextbit.it/">Nextbit</a>. I apply deep learning at work, and I study the theory behind it in my spare time.

    I search for elegance in the world. In particular, I look for beauty in maths, solutions to hard problems, art, and cooking.
    I want to inspire people and be inspired by them.

    I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics in Bologna at Collegio Superiore. I continued my studies with a Master's Degree in Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning in Paris at Université Paris Descartes and École Normale Supérieure de Paris-Saclay.
    Now I'm working in Milan at Nextbit as an Artificial Intelligence Expert.

    Maths and computer science have always fascinated me.
    Machine learning combines maths and computer science, so it was a natural choice for my career path. After some years spent applying machine learning, I noticed that many people hide or disregard the mathematics in machine learning.

    This blog is for brave computer scientists, data scientist, and statisticians who are not afraid of maths. At the same time, it could help mathematicians and physicists feel comfortable with machine learning thanks to proven theorems.
